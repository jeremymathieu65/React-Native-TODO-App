# To-Do List Application Built with React Native

This is a repo containing all of the code for a simple To-Do List application built with React Native.
The main features of the app include: 

1 - Ability to create a new account

2 - Ability to add/delete/edit tasks

3 - Ability to update account credentials

The main logic of the app is handled by a custom context hook built with React's context API. The app uses `AsyncStorage` or `localStorage` as its data store (there is no hosted backend or database).
